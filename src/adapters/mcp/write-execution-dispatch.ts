/**
 * Issue #785 (v2.1.1) — write-execution dispatch seam.
 *
 * Centralizes the two adjustments the dispatch layer applies on top of a
 * caller-supplied payload before forwarding to the VBA-sync adapter:
 *
 * 1. `resolveEffectiveDryRunInput` — when the caller did not pass `dryRun`
 *    AND did not pass `apply`, inject the policy-driven effective default
 *    (`dryRun: false` in `developer` mode for `routine-dev-write` tools;
 *    `dryRun: true` everywhere else). Explicit caller intent is preserved
 *    verbatim — a caller can always force execution with `dryRun: false` /
 *    `apply: true` or a dry-run with `dryRun: true`, regardless of policy.
 *
 * 2. `requiresExportSourceConfirmation` — when the policy yields
 *    `requiresConfirmOverwriteSource === true` (i.e. `developer` mode for
 *    a `destructive-write` tool), the export-source guard checks that the
 *    caller's export destination does NOT overlap the project's active
 *    source root unless `confirmOverwriteSource: true` is passed.
 *
 * Both helpers are pure and dependency-free; they consume the v2.1.0
 * foundation (`resolveWriteExecutionPolicy`, `effectiveDryRunDefaultForTool`)
 * without mutating it.
 *
 * The dispatch seam lives in `src/adapters/mcp/` because it consumes
 * adapter-layer route metadata (`MCP_TOOL_ROUTES`, `MCP_TOOL_RISKS`) and
 * its output is fed into the dispatch handler. The pure resolver stays
 * in `src/core/runtime/` — this helper is a thin policy-application layer
 * over that resolver.
